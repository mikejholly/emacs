;;; window-history.el --- Window layout history undo/redo -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; A simple minor mode to track window layout changes in Emacs and
;; navigate them like undo/redo history.  Layouts are recorded automatically
;; as you work.  Forward history is invalidated if you change layout
;; after stepping back.
